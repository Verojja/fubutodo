* The FubuRegistry class is Warner_TODOFubuRegistry.  Use this class to register custom policies or
  configure FubuMVC application settings




* StructureMap configuration is in the file Warner_TODORegistry
* StructureMap's default 'IFoo is Foo' conventions are configured for this project

The FubuMVC application is defined in the Warner_TODOApplication class.  It's unlikely that you'll
need to customize the application bootstrapping, but Warner_TODOApplication is where that would
happen.  You will want to refer to this class later if you use multiple forms of hosting (ASP.Net, 
Katana, or Serenity).


* The home page is served by HomeEndpoint.Index()
* HomeEndpoint.Index() could be eliminated if you choose
  to use Home.Spark as an 'actionless view'
* Shared/Application.spark is the master layout for the application
* Do check out the available Spark bindings in Shared/bindings.xml
